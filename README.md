# DataWarehousing_BusinessIntelligence
Design and develop an ETL job.

We will be working with a football-related database downloaded from Stats-Bomb, a UK-based company that excels in the football analytics field. More specifically, we will be focusing on the data from the 2018 World Cup that took place in Russia, in which the national team of France became the new and current Champions du Monde.
